# The recipe app

One of my side project next to 42 school studies to learn Javascript, combined with HTML and CSS.
This project was a great moment to get introduce these 3 different coding language, and get a better understanding how apps made,
how they working, how to cobmine these three language together and how to use inspection mode on Google Chrome.

The project using API database from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

## Future plan with this side project

    • Make it as an app which can be available on Google play store and app store
    • Create my own API database, based on my granny's own recipe book
    • Replace the english API with granny's Hungarian language database recipes
